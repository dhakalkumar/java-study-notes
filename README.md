Study notes for java

### Introduction
These are my personal study notes inspired from jwasham's coding interview university https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university
but this list is more specific to java while jwasham's repository covers other languages as well.
Feel free to fork / star / download ... whatever you want.
